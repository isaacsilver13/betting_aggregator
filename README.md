# Betting Aggregator

Standalone NFL and NBA odds comparison app.

## Current slice

- FastAPI backend with a canonical event and odds contract.
- Provider protocol plus a credential-free empty provider.
- Credential-free fixture provider for local UI development (`ODDS_PROVIDER=fixture`).
- React/Vite frontend shell for side-by-side comparison.
- The Odds API adapter is available when `THE_ODDS_API_KEY` is configured.
- Optional PostgreSQL persistence stores refresh runs, events, provider mappings,
  and immutable offer observations.
- Canonical event IDs normalize team aliases and five-minute start-time buckets;
    provider-specific offer IDs remain attached to each observation.
- Cached refreshes use single-flight locking, stale last-known-good fallback,
    retry/backoff, and configurable low-quota throttling.
- `GET /api/v1/history?event_id=...&market_type=...` reads immutable historical
    observations when persistence is enabled.

## Run locally

### Backend

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e ".[dev]"
docker compose up -d postgres
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir backend --reload --port 8000
```

To load deterministic sample odds without spending provider credits:

```powershell
$env:ODDS_PROVIDER = "fixture"
$env:PERSISTENCE_ENABLED = "true"
uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir backend --reload --port 8000
```

To use real NFL lines from The Odds API locally, copy `.env.example` to `.env`,
fill in the key, and select live mode before starting the backend:

```dotenv
# .env (keep this file untracked)
THE_ODDS_API_KEY=replace-with-your-key
PROVIDER_MODE=live
ODDS_PROVIDER=the_odds_api
PERSISTENCE_ENABLED=false
```

PowerShell variables take precedence over `.env` if you prefer session-only
configuration:

```powershell
$env:THE_ODDS_API_KEY = "replace-with-your-key"
$env:PROVIDER_MODE = "live"
$env:ODDS_PROVIDER = "the_odds_api"
$env:PERSISTENCE_ENABLED = "false"
uvicorn app.main:app --app-dir backend --reload --port 8000
```

Then verify the provider and request NFL odds:

```powershell
curl.exe "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/odds?sport=nfl"
```

The response should report `the_odds_api` as the configured provider and return
the current events, bookmakers, moneylines, spreads, totals, and any alternate
spreads returned by the upstream API. The frontend uses the same response and
does not receive or manage the API key.

`THE_ODDS_API_KEY` takes precedence over fixture mode when both are set, but
`PROVIDER_MODE=live` is still required. Never commit a real key. Set
`PERSISTENCE_ENABLED=false` to run without a database. Migrations are
reversible with `alembic downgrade base`.

`PROVIDER_MODE=fixture` is the application default when no environment is
provided and never makes live provider calls. Set `PROVIDER_MODE=live`
explicitly before using `THE_ODDS_API_KEY`. The
`PROVIDER_MIN_QUOTA_REMAINING` setting defaults to `5`; when a live provider
reports that remaining quota is at or below this value, the cache suppresses
another refresh and serves the last successful snapshot when one exists.

With persistence enabled, observations and refresh runs older than
`OBSERVATION_RETENTION_DAYS` are pruned after each refresh. Failed provider
refreshes are recorded with their typed error and are not stored as empty
successful observations.

The API surface is intentionally read-only:

- `GET /api/v1/health`
- `GET /api/v1/status`
- `GET /api/v1/odds?sport=nfl|nba`
- `GET /api/v1/odds?sport=...&event_id=...&market_type=...&force_refresh=true`
- `GET /api/v1/history?event_id=<canonical-id>&market_type=<market>&limit=...`

The comparison board includes a refresh action on each event. It refreshes
only the currently selected market for that event and merges the result into
the existing board, leaving the other events and markets in place.

There is no automated bet placement or sportsbook account integration.

### Frontend

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite development server proxies `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
